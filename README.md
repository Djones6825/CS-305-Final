# CS-305-Final

My client was Artemis Financial. They had security concerns with their data base and I was tasked with finding and fixing mistakes as well as removing false positives.
Using Maven 12.1.0 I compared the libraries used to what had known vulnerabilities and took steps to correct the known issues. 
It was important to correct these issues to maintain trust in the system and keep client company information safe from outside access and attacks.
I verified the systems by running static tests to make sure data paths, libraries, and corrections i made did not end functionality and worked as intended.
I suppressed fixed issues that gave a false positive by a suppression POML file and updated libraries to a more current verision to fix data leaks by known exploits.
In the future, I'd like to compare Maven's reported issue data base with other verified data bases like those spoken about by our professor, SonarQube and Snyk.
Being able to have a system versitile enough to be integrated and tested by multiple systems would benifit the project greatly by offering a maximum trust of security.
My future employers would see that I am able to correctly identify issues versus false positives. I am able to integrate security concerns into an already built system and that I can properly verify security.
